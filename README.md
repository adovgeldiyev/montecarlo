Overlapping Ellipses
An ellipse is a curve in a plane surrounding two focal points such that the sum of the distances to the two focal points is constant for every point on the curve. – Wikipedia.
Part 1: Ellipse Class 
A. Write a class to capture the necessary information of an ellipse.
B. Write code to thoroughly test your implementation of the ellipse class including:
a. A constructor that accepts no variables.
b. A constructor that accepts all appropriate variables.
c. Setting and getting the appropriate variables.
d. A function that returns the area of the ellipse
e. A function that returns the circumference of the ellipse.
Part 2: Structure Chart 
Using the top-down strategy discussed in class, produce a structure chart to capture the necessary steps for computing the overlap of two ellipses using the Monte Carlo Technique.
A. Each block of the chart should capture the requirements of a function.
B. Label each edge with the input and output of the function, similar to the examples given in class.
Part 3: Implementation (25 Points)
Implement your solution described by your structure chart. Your function should accept two Ellipse objects (defined in part 1) and return the area of their overlap. Use a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the overlap. If they do not overlap, return 0.
Part 4: Unit Testing 
For this part, you will thoroughly test your implementation. For EVERY function, beginning with the lowest level functions:
A. Print the name of the function.
B. Print the doctstring of the function.
C. Print the rationale for the test (e.g. “Testing when a point falls within an Ellipse.”)
D. Print the specific input used to evaluate that rationale.
E. Print the result.
F. Repeat C – E until all relevant cases are tested for that function.
